DriverPass


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  
  The client was a company called DriverPass who saw a void in the arena of Driver’s Education and a low rate of testers passing. They wanted to create an online system (website) that provides study material and exams as well as the option for on-the-road driving to improve passing rates and fill the void. 


What did you do particularly well?

A part of the development of the system that I feel I did extremely well was creating a well documented and clear Business Requirement document. I ensured that I captured all of the client’s wants and needs as well as the functional and non-functional system requirements that will produce a great system. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I had to select a part for revision, I would select to improve my system design document, specifically, by adding 2-3 more technical requirements that I put into my visual document but not my written document.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user’s needs I first read through the interview transcript. I then utilized my Business Requirement document template broken into smaller sections focusing on one section at time and what the section was asking. I then reviewed the interview once more to answer the questions within the working section. I did this several times until the documentation was completed. This ensured not only a well detailed document but also that every part of the requirements and planning involved the client by incorporating their feedback of wants and needs throughout development. Taking the client’s needs into consideration is absolutely critical during development for several reasons. The most important reason is that essentially the product is for them, not us. Another reason is that our end goal is to provide excellent customer service and deliver a great product. Finally, we will reduce the use of invaluable time and resources from not having to constantly redo parts of the project throughout development if we are utilizing the client's needs throughout development. 


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to software design involves analyzing and processing the user requirements and constraints of the system and developing ways that I can do both - meet the client’s requirements and reduce and/or rectify the constraints. I will work with my team to create a rough-draft of the solutions and layout for the system and present them to clients for feedback before officially developing the system. After feedback is received and processed my team and I can begin designing the system .Throughput development since we will be utilizing a Scrum Agile approach, I will include the client for participation throughout to encourage continuous feedback and catch and rectify any changes that are needed in an effective and timely manner.
